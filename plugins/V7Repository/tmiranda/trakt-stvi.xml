  <ReleaseNotes>Version 0.17:
- See the changelog from the v0.17 General plugin.

Version 0.16:
- The UI now displays if a show has been synced with Trakt.
- The user can now use the UI to specify shows that will be excluded from tracking and scrobbling.
- Added ability to sync from Trakt to Sage on demand.
- Reduced the number of System Messages that are created.
- When scrobbling starts the trakt_id is saved in the metadata for future use. This improves performance.
- If a shows fails to start scrobbling, do not try to stop scrobbling.
- Added specific error checks for Trakt being unavailable as this is all too common.  Future versions will include better recovery from this.
- Cleaned up destroy() to make sure resources are freed if the user disables the plugin.
- Fixed a bug that would cause the config menu to hang if the user access code expires and automatic reauthentication fails.
- Fixed a bug that would cause GetHistory to not properly calculate the start and end times if a range was given.
- Fixed a bug that would cause GetHistory to fail if another episode of a show that was watched on Trakt was in the Sage database.

Version 0.12:
  - Initial STVi release.</ReleaseNotes>
