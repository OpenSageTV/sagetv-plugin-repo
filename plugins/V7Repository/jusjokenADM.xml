  <Name>ADM - Another Dynamic Menu</Name>

  <Identifier>jusjokenADM</Identifier>

  <Description>

  A new approach to an old request - Another Dynamic Menu (ADM)

   - works with Standard SageTV as well as with Diamond (see Diamond section in the Wiki)

   - ADM Manager is always available from the Main Menu Options menu

   - QLM - Quick Launch Menu - always available from nearly any SageTV screen

   - How it works

     - on initial load ADM will load a dynamic "Standard SageTV" menu item list

     - ADM uses the Standard SageTV "Menu System" to display a dynamic list of user customizable Menu Items

     - the menu Look and Feel is not ADM's - as it uses this from SageTV

     - you can add, delete, hide any Menu Item or even start from scratch (Delete ALL) and build an entire new custom Menu

     - you can Copy existing SageTV or Plugin added Menu Items to create new ADM Menu Items

     - you can Create new Video Folder Browser Menu Items through the ADM Copy mode feature

     - you can Create new File Browser Menu Items through the ADM Copy mode feature

     - if you "mess up" you can always load the default menus and start again

     - the menu items are saved at the client level but can be Exported and Imported from other clients

     - you can get to your menu quickly by using the optional QLM feature

        * Can be filtered by Music, TV, Video, etc

        * Filter can be set to "sticky" to be available for subsequent uses when creating/adusting multiple similar menu items

        * Previous Users of ADM: if you have minor modifications to your ADM menus then I recommend loading the Default Menus with this version and then applying your minor modifications again.  This will allow you to take full advantage of showing/hiding all menu items as well as use the new QLM feature.  If you have larger modifications and your current menus are working well for you then there is no need to change as this version is fully backwards compatible.
