1.0.7 - Fixes Astra 19.2ÂºE channels support.
1.0.8 - Implement variable alignment sync algorithm.
1.0.9 - Improved CPU usage. Fixes rare instability issue on closing SageTV.
1.1.0 - Introducing the parallel decrypter algorithm. License scheme in place.
1.1.1 - Introducing the dynamic multi packet algorithm.
1.1.2 - Fixes the random 'no signal' issue requiring second attempt. Added proper IRDETO support. Added more card validation logging.
1.1.3 - Fixes some transponders doesn't contain the CAT table.
1.1.4 - Keep connection alive which can be important for some card readers.
1.1.5 - Support the 'in the middle of a program encryption switch' like what's happening on some Tivusat channels.
1.1.6 - Fix FireDTV support. Fix glitch on multiple high bitrate HD recordings. Increased tuning speed.

Automatic dynamic card reader allocation for each tuner to evenly balance cards usage. The oscam.user file gets only regenerated after modification to oscam.server, otherwise left untouched allowing users to add other personal accounts not related to STV, also no need to restart OsCAM server any more. Improved encrypted channels tuning speed. Typically 2/3 seconds from pressing the play button on a program from EPG to watching. New and improved tuner identification algorithm, this works in conjunction with the Java plugin. Channel scan support. Improved installation and registering of the filter from Windows 7 (32/64) onwards.
1.2.1 - Fixes minor bugs in transport stream handling in particular on encrypted channels.
1.2.2 - Automatically installs the 32/64 bit version of the filter.
