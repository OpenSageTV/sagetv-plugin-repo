<Description>

This plugin gives users the ability to import their own custom channel lineup. This plugin can also be used to export "enabled" channels on a lineup.



How to Import a Channel Lineup:



1) Main Menu...Setup...Setup Video Sources...Select your video source...Channel Setup...Edit Channel Lineup..."Import Channel Lineup". A popup message should appear telling you that a file was created in the SageTV directory.

2) Open the "name-of-video-source.import" file that was generated in the previous step, add your channel info, save, and close the file.

***Note: If you are importing channels for a digital tuner(ATSC, DVB, QAM), the "CH:" number in the "name-of-video-source.import" must match the "CH:" number in the "name-of-video-source.frq" file. This does not apply to video inputs(Composite, S-Video, Component) since they do not need tuning info.

3) In SageTV, run "Import Channel Lineup" again. Your channels should now be added to the channel lineup.

How to Export a Channel Lineup:



1) Main Menu...Setup...Setup Video Sources...Select your video source...Channel Setup.

2) Make sure all the channel you want exported are "enabled".

3) Edit Channel Lineup..."Export Enabled Channels on Lineup".

4) A file called "name-of-video-source.export" will be created in the SageTV directory.

***Note: In order to re-import the channels you will need to change the file extension from ".export" to ".import". Also, if the exported channels are from a digital tuner(ATSC, DVB, QAM), make a backup of the "name-of-video-source.frq" file.
