- Cleaned up code.
- Improved logging.

- Fixed bug that would sometimes cause only 1 job to start even though more than 1 could have been started.
- Fixed bug that prevented jobs queued after scan from starting until after a SageEvent.

  <Description>Various enhancements for the OSD (time remaining and play toggle).
   - Adds the amount of time remaining to the OSD.  The display will then indicate the time that has already played as well as the amount of time remaining to play. 
   - Enables a toggle effect with the play button, so pressing play when the OSD is displayed will remove the OSD from the display.

    <![CDATA[
Version 2.0.1
    Changes to support Jetty 9
Version 1.3.5
    Modifying the resolutions.
Version 1.3.4
    Try to use the original video's frame rate.
    Adjust bit rates based on initial quality.

Version 1.3.3
    Starting at higher initial bit rate.
    Disabled -bt.
    Reduced volume to 512.
    Increased audio bit rate to 64kbps.
    Removed the 640 kBps quality.

Version 1.3.2 
    Removed the 1840 kBps quality.
    Reordered the qualities.

Version 1.3.1 
   Disabled the authentication to enable Android streaming.
	
Version 1.3.0 
    1. Increased the resolutions.
    2. Reduced the frame rate at lower bit rate.
    3. Added one higher bit rate.
    4. Replaced left over SageTV.API calls by sagex ones.
    5. Removed the unknown user agents restrictions.
    6. Implemented some Eclipse recommendations.
    7. Increased the audio bit rate by 20%.
    
Version 1.2.0
1. Rethrow IllegalArgumentException so and HTTP error code will be returned if the URL contains invalid parameters
2. Log error messages
3. Return HTTP error code if exception thrown by servlets
4. Return exception message as content body
5. Change response content type
6. Pass servlet request object to playlist generators
7. Calculate aspect ratio from width and height if it's not provided by SageTV metadata
8. Add support for Android and Lavf (ffmpeg-based players such as VPlayer and Mirage) User-Agents.  This does not necessarily mean these will immediately work in clients that use this service.  Those must be fixed separately by their developers.
9. Return more meaningful errors if Quality or User-Agent parameters are invalid.
10. Refactor HTTP Live Streaming Playlist Code
11. Put absolute URLs in HTTP Live Streaming Playlists
 
Version 1.1.2
1. Fix bug in HTTP Live Streaming servlets that returns HTTP 500 and results in a crossed out play button on the video thumbnail.  Attempting to start playback by clicking the thumbnail or Watch Now -> On this Page was unresponsive.
 
Version 1.1.1
1. Fix bug in HTTP Live Streaming playlist generation
 
Version 1.1.0
1. Increase volume on HTTP Live Streaming videos.
2. Create a default web page to explain that this plugin is not used directly by the user.
3. Use SageTV's ffmpeg for transcoding.  The web streaming should now support the same files as the Sage core.  Some users had reported problems with playing or seeking through avi, mkv, mpeg2, and wmv files.
4. Fixed problems watching shows currently being recorded.
  - Playback duration was the length of the recording when playback began
  - Playback would fail if started immediately after recording started
5. Added a URL to allow clients to kill transcoding processes on the server.  The Mobile Web Interface does not use this API.
6. Added more logging detail
 
Version 1.0.0
1. Real-time variable bitrate transcoding of SageTV recordings to iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad devices.

  <Description>
    <![CDATA[
Provides a platform for SageTV web application plugins.
 
Currently available web applications can manage SageTV recordings from desktop or mobile web browsers, manage fanart and metadata, provide remote web services for SageTV, configure batch job processing, and more.
 
The plugin consists of two parts.  The first part is Jetty, a 3rd-party Java web server from the Eclipse Foundation that can be embedded in a Java program such as SageTV.  The second part is a set of plugin classes created by the author that interact with SageTV to start, stop, and configure the Jetty web server.

	<Description><![CDATA[

SJQ allows users to selectively perform tasks on any and all SageTV objects.



NOTE: SJQv4 requires a sagetv-addons license to unlock all features.  If you're upgrading from SJQv3 then you will require a license file to unlock all features.  DO NOT UPGRADE IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO DONATE.  THERE IS NO DOWNGRADE OPTION AVAILABLE IN SAGETV FOR PLUGINS SO ONCE YOU UPGRADE YOU ARE COMMITTED TO VERSION 4!!



SJQ can be used to selectively perform various tasks on your SageTV objects.  The most common use is to selectively perform comskip on recordings known to have commercials while ignoring recordings from channels known not to have commercials (HBO, PBS, PPV, etc.).



Please see the user's guide for all the details, including common usage setup and examples.

    <ReleaseNotes>
# 3.5.0
* Updated to use the new TVDB V4 provider free of charge thanks to a negotiated license with TheTVDB
# 3.4.3
* Added TMDB as a free TV provider
* Added TVDB V4 as a TV provider - needs a PIN with a subscription to TVDB
* Fix: Old TVDB provider should now work on Java 11
* Fix: if Fanart is disabled (local and central), metadata will still be retrieved unless Automatic  Fanart/Metadata is disabled

# 3.3.1
* Removed weather functionality as all included providers are no longer available
* Weather for Gemstone and SageTV is now handled by the GWeather plugin

# 3.2.3
* Fanart Image fix (redirection not handled correctly)

# 3.2.2
* Weather Fixes
* While each provider can have it's own update check interval, the main API will one as well (configurable) and any attempt to Update() the weather during this interval will be ignored.
* The API will ignore changes that are the same. ie, setting same provider over and over, or setting the same units or locations, etc, will just be ignored, and not passed to the implementation.
* The weather configuration can be "locked" (in BMT Weather Configuration). ie, if you have weather set to Yahoo with a location and units, you can "lock" it so that any API request to change this this will be ignored. I did this mainly because of a bug in Gemstore where it keeps changing my weather provider and units
* SageTV Debugging - Exposed SageTV debugging flags to BMT Web UI (configuration)
 
# 3.2.1
* Fixes to allow failed TV lookups to retry (most failures are "Too many connections")

# 3.2.0
* Rewrote TVDB lookups using TVDB API

# 3.1.0
* Fixed various scraper issues for metadata/fanart (primarily around bluray and dvd)
* Removed HTBackdrops (api/site no longer available)
* Fixed failing JUnit tests

# 3.0.7
* Added Channel Grouper

# 3.0.6
* Fixed Fanart color issues
* Fanart Scaled automatically to max screen size on download
* On Save, will try to fetch fanart, if fanart is missing
* Added Config option to rescale source fanart
* Refactored "timer" code to use common Executors
* Added support for common menu actions to be shared across menus


# 3.0.4
* Fixed possible plugin deadlock when using SageTVEventBus

# 3.0.3
* Added support for font icon mappings

# 3.0.2
* Xml Validation will not completely fail if there are missing views, filters, sources, etc.  It will continue to load the views and flag the views with errors.
* Fixed bug where WeatherAPI was generating with compile errors.

<Description>
<![CDATA[The webfeedencoder is a means to get web based streaming TV and radio and device output available in SageTV and its extenders as if they were regular channels.

As far as SageTV is concerned the webfeedencoder behaves like another TV tuner.

The excellent VLC media player software is used to tune to the internet TV or radio station, add video to the radio, and dump to an MPEG2 file for SageTV.

The means of tuning and detuning is completely configurable so any source of video or audio could be fed to SageTV via the webfeedencoder.

The webfeedencoder also includes an EPG grabber to harvest schedules from the web pages and other sources and update SageTVs program guide without need for an XMLTV importer.

Feeds can also be added to online services menu in SageTV.

A configuration tool is provided which allows you to:

    * Find and configure new channels and online services.
    * Test the channels and EPG harvest.
    * Perform ad-hoc EPG updates.
    * Manage your SageTV channel lineup and online services.

NOTE: You must install VLC seperately in order for the plugin to work. Version 1.0.5 is recommended.]]>

  <ReleaseNotes>Known Issues:

- May not work for Live TV. (Needs more testing.)

- Will not work for DVD or BluRay.



Version 0.07:

- Added option to pause/unpause when Up and Down are pressed.

- Added option to turn debug logging on and off.

- Added option to display thumbnails at commercial breaks.

Version 0.04:

  	<Description>Java Heap Monitor for SageTV 7.



Running low on heap space is one of the main causes of "sluggishness" in SageTV.  This STVi puts a small bar graph in the menu header which shows how much Java heap space is available.



To configure the STVi navigate to Setup->Detailed Setup->Customize and look for Java Heap Monitor near the end of the list.</Description>

  	<ReleaseNotes>Beta 1.70:

- Add ability to mark episodes as recorded even if they have not been. This is useful to "catch up" and only record new episodes rather than having to record all previous episodes.

- Add Database Browser function to aid in debugging user problems.

- More fixes for Channels.com.  (Still not 100% reliable.) Fixes may have the side effect of allowing individual PlayOn items to be recorded but this needs further investigation.

- Fix bug that prevented Channels.com items from being downloaded if the menu had been reloaded.

- If the user has specified a download directory it will be monitored for old files.

- Fix NullPointerException caused when looking at some ChannelsDotCom items.

- Fix bug that caused all Favorite information to be lost when upgrading. (Upgrading to version 1.70 will result in all Favorite information being lost, but this should be the last time that happens.)

- Removed redundant database update to improve performance.



Beta 1.60:

- Add support for Channels.com. (But it's still not working correctly.)

- Can now record single Episodes from PlayOn.  Recording multiple Episodes and selecting PlayOn items as a Favorite is not supported.

- If in Recorded TV menu add Favorite icon next to Podcasts that are Favorites. If using the malore menus the icon will only show up if using double rows on the right side.

- If in Online menu add RSS icon next to Podcasts that have been recorded.

- Add ability to jump to Online Favorite Manager from recording option menus.

- Add ability to record more than the default number of displayed items (usually 20) for Podcasts such as YouTube Channels.

- Fix bug that prevented Favorite Podcast from being removed from the Online Favorite Manager after it was removed as a favorite.

- Fix bug that allowed pressing Favorite and Record on non Podcasts items such as Back, Next and Previous.

- Fix bug that caused Favorite Options dialog to not use default values set by user.

- Fix bug that would cause the Favorite status of recorded Episodes to remain the same even though the user changed the Favorite status of the Podcast.

- Fix bug that prevented MediaFile metadata from getting the correct Favorite status.

- Improve error message that is displayed if adding a Favorite fails.



Beta 1.50:

- Fixed bug that caused Podcasts to be recorded more than one time.

- Added check to make sure server and client have the same version installed.

- Begin to add support for Channels.com but it's still not completed.

- In Recording menu display RSS icon next to items that are Podcasts.

- In Online menu display RSS icon next to Podcasts that have been recorded.

- Cosmetic enhancement to options menu that appears when Podcast is selected.



Beta 1.40:

- Updated for SageTV version 7.1.

- Fixed bug that caused large memory usage leading to SageTV to slowdowns.

- When browsing recorded shows that are Podcasts, suppress the Favorite options.

- When displaying detailed info for recorded Podcasts, suppress the Misc data since it contains internal information.

	<Name>TVExplorer</Name>

	<Identifier>TVE</Identifier>

	<Description><![CDATA[TVExplorer is a replacement screen for the Recordings screens. It duplicates most/all of the functionality on those screens. Its layout is similar to Windows Explorer and/or the Malore Menus but has a number of differences/advantages.



*	Very customizable to get the exact look/feel the user is after

* Fully supports fanart/posters/banners.

* Multiple different grouping/sorting/filtering settings.

* Displays imported TV (videos that are TV but are not part of the Sage recording DB) alongside recorded TV. (It is possible to limit the scope of the imported TV search to certain directories using pathfilterexpressions or a property item. I recommend doing this with large dvd/bd collections)

* Leverages metadata collected by BMT or mediascraper to determine if a particular video is TV and also displays season/episode information

* Filters groups by Record Year, Original Airing Year, or Season/Episode.



Note:

This is based on a port of TVE v1.01.028 for SageMC to the STV3 Default STV and then to the SageTV7 STV by tmiranda.  Thanks tmiranda :) This is an interim release until TVE v2 is ready for release.]]>

  <Name>"Diamond MKANET Mod" sub-theme</Name>

  <Identifier>diamond-mkanet-sub-theme</Identifier>

  <Description>The purpose of this sub-theme is to enhance 'Diamond for Default SageTV7 STV' default graphics by offering a bonus sub-theme called, 'Diamond MKANET Mod'.  This sub-theme was originally made to modify Diamond to suit my taste.  I prefer 'warmer' color tones and more graphics variety.  See screenshots.

  <Name>Canadian Channel Logo Pack</Name>
  <Identifier>canadianchannellogopack</Identifier>
  <Description>A complete collection of hi-res channel logos (600x300 JPG's) cleaned up and scaled with Photoshop on black backgrounds for the following areas,

BELL EAST
BELL WEST
TELUS TV CALGARY
TELUS TV SAT BC AB
BELL TV CABLE TORONTO
SHAW CALGARY DIGITAL
SHAW DIRECT EAST (Starchoice)
SHAW DIRECT WEST (Starchoice)
SHAW NANAIMO DIGITAL
SHAW VANCOUVER DIGITAL
SHAW VICTORIA DIGITAL
SHAW EDMONTON DIGITAL
SHAW SASKATOON DIGITAL
SHAW WINNEPEG DIGITAL
SHAW KELOWNA DIGITAL
SHAW PRINCEGEORGE DIGITAL
ROGERS TORONTO DIGITAL
ROGERS KITCHENER GRAND RIVER DIGITAL
ROGERS BRAMPTON DIGITAL
ROGERS MISS REXDALE DIGITAL
ROGERS OTTAWA DIGITAL
COGECO OAKVILLE DIGITAL
VIDEOTRON MONTREAL
VIDEOTRON QUEBEC CITY DIGITAL

This pack contains 960 logos named to work with the above providers and lineups verifed on Zap2it within the last few weeks.  All channels are included and I hope by picking the lineups above I will have created enough overlap for the other areas not included.  You should be able to just install this set and all channels should show up without renaming the files etc.  There is a chance that if you are not in one of the above areas that the odd channel might be missing (local or specialty etc) and you will have to source the missing channel image.

The download is about 20MB in size.

I will be converting the whole set to transparent logos as I have time in the near future.

Disclaimer - I have done my best to research (Google, Wikipedia, Lyngsat) and choose the correct logo for each channel but there is a chance that there may be some logos that won't match so please let me know and I will correct.  International logos were a bit of a problem as most channels didn't have a hi res image availible but I think they turned out ok most of the time.

  <Name>Import/Export Channel Lineup</Name>

  <Identifier>ImportExportChannelLineup</Identifier>



<Description>

This plugin gives users the ability to import their own custom channel lineup. This plugin can also be used to export "enabled" channels on a lineup.



How to Import a Channel Lineup:



1) Main Menu...Setup...Setup Video Sources...Select your video source...Channel Setup...Edit Channel Lineup..."Import Channel Lineup". A popup message should appear telling you that a file was created in the SageTV directory.

2) Open the "name-of-video-source.import" file that was generated in the previous step, add your channel info, save, and close the file.

***Note: If you are importing channels for a digital tuner(ATSC, DVB, QAM), the "CH:" number in the "name-of-video-source.import" must match the "CH:" number in the "name-of-video-source.frq" file. This does not apply to video inputs(Composite, S-Video, Component) since they do not need tuning info.

3) In SageTV, run "Import Channel Lineup" again. Your channels should now be added to the channel lineup.

.

.

How to Export a Channel Lineup:



1) Main Menu...Setup...Setup Video Sources...Select your video source...Channel Setup.

2) Make sure all the channel you want exported are "enabled".

3) Edit Channel Lineup..."Export Enabled Channels on Lineup".

4) A file called "name-of-video-source.export" will be created in the SageTV directory.

***Note: In order to re-import the channels you will need to change the file extension from ".export" to ".import". Also, if the exported channels are from a digital tuner(ATSC, DVB, QAM), make a backup of the "name-of-video-source.frq" file.

       <Name>Sage Object Properties (SOP)</Name>
       <Identifier>sop</Identifier>
       <Description>
Provides ability to attach properties to objects not supported by the core Sage API.

This plugin provides a single API that allows getting and setting of properties for all objects supported by the Sage API plus those object types supported by this plugin.

This plugin adds support for attaching properties to Show and Airing objects.  See the javadocs for the risks involved is attaching properties to these objects.

To set/get properties on objects, use the SageProps API provided by this plugin.  You can use this API to get/set properties on natively supported object types along with the objects supported by this plugin.  The API is, therefore, a single API that can be used for all property set/get operations.

The javadocs for the API are available at http://sagetv-addons.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/sop/docs/index.html

As an aside, it is worth noting that this plugin is implemented completely in Groovy script.  See http://forums.sagetv.com/forums/showthread.php?t=55166 for more details, if interested.

       <Name>Sage Download Manager (SDM)</Name>
       <Identifier>sdm</Identifier>
       <Description>SDM is an RPC controllable file download manager capable of downloading via HTTP(S), FTP(S), BitTorrent and others.

On its own, this plugin does not serve much purpose, but combined with other plugins, such as SJQv4, this plugin provides the download services component that other applications are built upon.

This plugin is simply a wrapper around the aria2 command line download utility.  In order for this plugin to operate, you must install aria2 on your SageTV server.  This wrapper uses command line options only available in aria2 v1.11.0 or later.

       <Description><![CDATA[
The sagetv-addons license server plugin provides a global validation point for all other plugins that require a sagetv-addons license file.  This plugin helps to centralize and simplify license validation in the other plugins that use sagetv-addons licensing.

Most users should NOT need to install this plugin manually.  Other plugins that need to validate this license will automatically install this plugin.  Manually installing and configuring this plugin ahead of time is also acceptable.

======
v1.3.1
======

It's life time licenses for everyone! This update removes license validation
and instead validates anything, everything, and everyone as a valid life time
license holder!

I'd like to thank everyone for their support over the years, especially to
those who have donated to the Canadian Cancer Society through their license
purchases! Your support of this charity is very much appreciated!

The PayPal button has been deleted and will no longer accept payments. My
PayPal payment processor/license generator has been taken offline and my
database of payee info will be destroyed in the very near future. Be sure
to upgrade to this version and you can forget about your license file!

======
v1.2.0
======

Support for IBM JREs; requires generation of new license files.

======
v1.1.1
======

Support for installation of license server on SageClients

======
v1.1.0
======

Support for new license file format.

======
v1.0.1
======

Ignore case when comparing email addresses.

======
v1.0.0
======

Initial release.

  <Name>The Complete Comcast Transparent Channel Logo Pack</Name>

  <Identifier>The Complete Comcast Transparent Channel Logo Pack</Identifier>

  <Description>High quality, transparent channel logos for Comcast subscribers (Originally meant for San Francisco Bay Area Comcast lineup).  Once you install this logo pack, you may need to rename some of the logo file names to match the channel names displayed in the SageTV's Guide.  You can rename the logo filenames under the sageTV program folder located: "..SageTVSageTVChannelLogos".  A big thanks to "karljayne" from our sageTV forums for supplying many of these icons.</Description>

  <Name>ADM - Another Dynamic Menu</Name>

  <Identifier>jusjokenADM</Identifier>

  <Description>

  A new approach to an old request - Another Dynamic Menu (ADM)

   - works with Standard SageTV as well as with Diamond (see Diamond section in the Wiki)

   - ADM Manager is always available from the Main Menu Options menu

   - QLM - Quick Launch Menu - always available from nearly any SageTV screen

   - How it works

     - on initial load ADM will load a dynamic "Standard SageTV" menu item list

     - ADM uses the Standard SageTV "Menu System" to display a dynamic list of user customizable Menu Items

     - the menu Look and Feel is not ADM's - as it uses this from SageTV

     - you can add, delete, hide any Menu Item or even start from scratch (Delete ALL) and build an entire new custom Menu

     - you can Copy existing SageTV or Plugin added Menu Items to create new ADM Menu Items

     - you can Create new Video Folder Browser Menu Items through the ADM Copy mode feature

     - you can Create new File Browser Menu Items through the ADM Copy mode feature

     - if you "mess up" you can always load the default menus and start again

     - the menu items are saved at the client level but can be Exported and Imported from other clients

     - you can get to your menu quickly by using the optional QLM feature

        * Can be filtered by Music, TV, Video, etc

        * Filter can be set to "sticky" to be available for subsequent uses when creating/adusting multiple similar menu items

      * New Dynamic List Actions

        * These menu items will be replaced with a dynamic list of menu items when they are displayed in the menus

        * Available Types

          * Music Playlist - current list of Music Playlists

          * Diamond Custom Flows - list of currently configured Diamond Custom Flows

      * New Malore Actions

        * Malore menu actions have been added/updated to work with the CopyMode

      * Updated Default Menus

        * All menu items in the Default Menus are now ADM controllable menu items

        * Note: SageTV Submenus are still supported and can be used with ADM except in the new QLM feature

        * Previous Users of ADM: if you have minor modifications to your ADM menus then I recommend loading the Default Menus with this version and then applying your minor modifications again.  This will allow you to take full advantage of showing/hiding all menu items as well as use the new QLM feature.  If you have larger modifications and your current menus are working well for you then there is no need to change as this version is fully backwards compatible.

       <Name>Sage Artifact Delete (SAD)</Name>
       <Identifier>sad</Identifier>
       <Description>Sage Artifact Delete is a simple plugin that will listen for media object deletion events and will delete any artifacts associated with the media object automatically.

This plugin is ideal for automatic cleanup of comskip files (edl), properties files, log files, etc.  By default the artifact deletion is delayed for 30 seconds.  This gives other processes a chance to copy the artifacts before SAD deletes them.

       <Name>Sage Recording Extender (SRE)</Name>

       <Identifier>sre</Identifier>

	<Description><![CDATA[

SRE monitors live events and extends the recording as necessary.  Don't let your recordings stop early and miss out on extra innings or overtime!



This plugin communicates with the Live PVR Data web service to determine if your recordings need to be extended because the recording is a live event.  Currently, the web service only supports monitoring of specific sporting events (NFL, NHL, MLB, NBA, NCAA football, NCAA basketball).  With this plugin enabled, all your recordings will be monitored against this web service and your recordings will be extended as necessary to ensure that you do not miss any portion of a live event because it runs longer than the EPG listings.



This plugin installs a web GUI app within the Jetty plugin for online viewing and configuration.  The SRE web app is installed at the /sre/ context within the Jetty plugin.

  <ReleaseNotes><![CDATA[
Build 413
1) 'Goto current time' enabled in EPG
2) Queuing Arrows added to horizontal navigation in LZ (can be enabled)
3) Don't allow playing of past airings
4) Refresh view after deleting a folder
5) Fixed select / enter handling when called from a music track.
6) Memories menu added to Landing Zone

Build 411
1. Misc updates for Phoenix
2. Misc updates for Phoenix 2

Build 410
1. Fixes bug whereby sometimes Phoenix would not load the first time on some systems

Build 409
1. Weather added (using Yahoo Weather) to top navbar and the Metro Landing Zone
2. Weather screen still not update
3. New weather backgrounds

Build 408
1. Weather functionality hidden (pending update for Google Weather)
2. Media Snapshot : Hitting 'Record' in the UMB while on a media item opens up the 'Media Snapshot' - this gives you 9 thumbnails of that recording, spaced evenly through the duration of the item. Easy way to check if you got the right recording.
3. Moved OSD volume / message area down a little so that it doesn't overlap with the top OSD elements.
4. Tweaked Comskip Autoskip logic, hopefully it will be more robust now. There is a small red dot added to the timebar when the Autoskip is active, this is to help with future debugging if it's not working.
5. Added Season / Episode info into EPG show info.
6. Updated Music browser to use optimized background loading
7. Title sort in the UMB can be configured to always ignore leading prepositions. This setting is in UMB options.
8. Added remote command listeners for "Video Library", "Picture Library", "Recording Schedule", "Live TV", "Library", "Setup", and "TV" sage commands.
9. Fixed bug in recording activity on landing zone so that it only shows today and tomorrow.

Build 407
1) Global UI options
* Simplified UI Options : This setting is enabled by default, and currently only effects the Detailed Information popup window. It basically simplifies the options that are visible by default. All the options are available, this just hides more of them initially. For instance, you have one option on an imported movie : 'Play'. As more areas of phoenix are modified for this 'minimal' approach, this setting will be tied into them.
* Resume Without Prompting : bypasses the 'Resume or start from beginnning' prompt when enabled.

2) New Universal Media Browser : "Inline" This browser replaces a lot of previous UMB variants - Movie Flow and Banner Flow are both being retired in favor of in this one. Old menu items using either of the old ones will still work, they just redirect to the Inline browser. It is called inline because browsing down to any folders happens 'inline'

3) Grid Flow UMB
* New options : direction of navigation (Horizontal or Vertical), hide-able information pane, as well as alpha masks that can be displayed on top of the background fanart.
* Speed improvements.
* Better illumination of the highlighted item in the grid.

4) Option in Video OSD called 'Auto Skip Activity Buffer' - this is a timer in milliseconds that disables autoskip functionality for that long after a user interaction. So if your autoskip hits before the commercial starts, you can skip back and it won't try to skip again.
5) Landing Zone TV : when there are conflicts a 'Resolve Conflicts' item is added to the menu that directs into the default STV's conflict resolution screen.
6) Parental Controls : Phoenix uses the Parental Lock Code defined in the default UI. Basically the way it works (in Phoenix) is that IF there is Parental Lock Code defined, parental controls are on. If you want to disable them you have to clear the code.
7) Other stuff.

Build 406
1) Fix for the Grid View not working on in build 405

Build 405
1) Two new landing zones. (Sage and Metro)
2) Fanart backgrounds for landing zones.
3) Music OSD - option added to always show the album cover during playback.
4) Music OSD - Fanart backgrounds supported as a wallpaper type. Note that this adds Fanart backgrounds, if available, to the music backgrounds, and biases the random selection towards artist backgrounds. But you will still see some of the generic music art.
4a) Fixed green bar or right edge of music OSD screen (not everyone was seeing this)
5) Universal Media Browser :
Select to Browse : this setting has been there for a while, but only active in the Single List. It is now used for both single list and banner flow. Basically this toggles the behaviour of the Right and Select keys - when enabled, Select navigates deeper into the VFS, and Right shows you the Detailed info for the folder (where you can delete all, or set all watched, etc).
Tall List : this is variation on Single List

New Option to hide the folder icon in the UMB.
6) Landing Zone Menu updates :
"Now Playing" item added to TV and Video (only visible when there is a video file going) and Music (only visible when there is music playing) - this is a menu item that gets you back to the playback screen.
"Play DVD" item added to Video menu - plays a physical DVD on clients if there is one in the drive.
7) Lots of little optimizations
8) Detailed Info popup for Folders tweaked so that it works better - you'll see this more often (see 'Select to Browse' above)
9) Music Browser
Alpha Filter support - hit numbers to filter the list down to items starting with a particular letter.
Action Menu support - Sort / Group on the fly are available. These are not sticky yet. Filters are not supported here yet either.
10) Weather Background flakiness fixed.
11) Action Menu - Grouping has an option now from the action menu to Keep or Prune folders - this gets rid of folders with a single item and promotes that item.
12) A bunch of other stuff.

Build 404
1) Music Support
2) New Filters (Recently Watched, Partially Watched)
3) New Groupers (First Letter)

Build 403
1) Full Screen EPG
2) Landing Zone:
Option to set the gradient level for cross bars in Horizontal and Cross
Added 'Customize Landing Zone' to the Global Options (contextual) menu, can be hidden
Recording activity refactored to show more consistently, also now it is 'Recording Soon' instead of today, looking at the next 24 hours rather than from now until midnight.
3) UMB Settings : new option to 'Show Watched Icon' in list items. Values are Never, TV, TV and Home Video, Always
4) Video OSD Settings : new setting to specify the alpha value of the OSD mask.
5) Landing Menu Customization
Removed most of the hidden by default entries in the Landing Menu
Added the ability to add Menu's and MenuItems to the Landing Menu
Menu Items that are added are currently limited to Media Browsers - the UI guides you through selecting a View and Browser to use.
6) Combined / consolidated vfs.xml and x-vfs.xml.
7) New skin called 'Ice'
8) Action Menu (UMB)
enabled filters. Filters are not sticky.

9) EPG Updates
Added day of week to the date shown in the top left corner.
Added option in Option Menu to goto the current time
Handle the record button
Direct entry of channel number now goes to that channel in the guide
For items in the guide that are currently airing, a delay before tuning is introduced when 'Select' is pressed. During this delay, you can hit 'select' again to see the detailed info, or 'left' to cancel tuning. Default duration of the delay is 2 seconds.
10) Moved Single List UMB and Detailed Info screens to use the Global Program Info - makes the info presented there more consistent with other places in the UI.
11) Added listener for 'SageTV Recordings' event. This is the 'Videos' key on the Sage remote control. Goes to the TV view with the Default UMB by default, although this mapping can be fully changed in XML / properties.

Moved the umb play/watched listeners into themes and added don't like listeners.
Added the play/watched/don't like listeners to the Box landing zone
Added a mouse click listener to the message alert icons to bring up the system messages display.

		<Name>SlimPlayer Internet Radio</Name>
		<Identifier>koelecslimplayer</Identifier>
		<Description>Slimplayer - Internet Radio (free and commercial services) streamed from Squeezebox Server.

Pandora, LastFM, Rapsody, Slacker, Live365, MediaFly, radioio, RadioTime, SHOUTcast, SIRIUS, Napster, Deezer....

Playback on SageTV local UI, Client UI and (with additional setup) on Extenders.

Requires separate install of Squeezebox Server software. The Squeezebox Server (formerly SlimServer and SqueezeCenter) is a streaming audio server supported by Logitech
(formerly Slim Devices), developed in particular to support their range of digital audio receivers. It is open source software. For download use first Webpage link.

SlimPlayer can run on SaveTV installations with local UI (server or client) without any additional setup (apart from this plugin and the Squeezebox Server software installation).

SlimPlayer can also run on extenders and Placeshifter with some additional setup/installation effort. Since SageTV cannot handle MP3 streams natively, two workaround methods are supported by SlimPlayer.
Hardware loopback is the easiest to setup, but requires a spare capture device (e.g. PVR150) being dedicated to SlimPlayer playback. The server's audio input is connected by cable to the capture device input.
Software loopback does not involve additional hardware. In this setup WFE (WebFeedEncoder) or UNE (Universal Network Encoder) is used to create a software capture device. Commercial software VAC (Virtual Audio Cable) is used to create a virtual audio device,
which will take the SlimPlayer's audio output and redirect that to the WFE/UNE capture device's audio input.

For setting up either option for use with extenders refer to the slimplayer-README.txt file you will find in the slimplayer folder after installation of this plugin.

The second Web page link refers to the forum discussion thread on SlimPlayer issues.

  <Name>J. River Media Center / Jukebox Explorer</Name>
  <Identifier>jrmcexplorer</Identifier>
  <Description>Take advantage of the powerful and flexible filtering, tagging, organizing, playlists, and dynamic smartlists of J. River Media Center for music, photos, and videos inside SageTV.  This also works with the free, music-only Media Jukebox application.  Note that the JRMC (or Jukebox) application has to be running in the backgound for this plugin but all playback is done within SageTV so this also works on extenders.  Your media files do not have to be imported into the Sage database (DVDs are the only exception).

  ** The JRMC (or Jukebox) application needs to be closed (not running) before installing or updating this plugin.  See the SageTV forum for one-time JRMC setup information.

       <Description>
Various Java classes and other tools to aid in the development of SageTV plugins.

This package contains common classes and tools I use to aid in the development of plugins.  Anytime I think something might be useful to
others, I'll add it to this package and make it available for all to use.  A very useful class in this package is the SagePluginThread class, which is an extension to java.lang.Thread that allows the thread to be halted gracefully at any time.  This is very nice for worker threads that should be stopped when SageTV or your plugin is stopped.  See the javadocs for futher details, including a usage example.

Other items of interest include an ant task to automatically submit your plugin manifest to SageTV's plugin repository.

To see exactly what's available in this version, see the javadocs link.

  <Description>This plugin will hide the volume icon and slider form the media player on screen display (OSD).  This plugin is particularly useful for users who have set up their remote to control volume through a different source (eg. A/V receiver) and do not have SageTV control the volume.</Description>

       <Name>Custom Events</Name>
       <Identifier>customevents</Identifier>
       <Description>
This plugin provides additional events that can be fired within the SageTV core event model system.  This plugin also provides passive support for SageAlert meaning that all the events provided by this plugin can also be configured for notification via SageAlert.  This version of the plugin provides the following events:

* Recording Space Low: Receive notifications when the free space on your recording drives drops below a configured threshold

Additional events will be added over time.  You can also suggest new events on the project web site.

This plugin also provides a complete example of how to create custom events for SageAlert and fire them into SageAlert for processing.

  <Name>VideoOut Tools for the Extenders</Name>
  <Identifier>videoouttools</Identifier>
  <Description>This stvi plugin adds a popup menu to choose the new output resolution of the extender interactively (similar to the "Detailed Setup" > Multimedia > "Output Resolution" menu in the default STV). The menu is mapped to the "Video Out" remote button while in the media player.  It also can display the current mediafile's resolution and the extenders output on the OSD (this can be disabled thru Video Tools Options).

This STVi replaces the default behavior of the "Video Out" remote button while in the Media Player. In other portions of the UI the "Video Out" button is the default behavior (cycling through available resolutions).

To access Video Tools Options: press "Video Out" on the remote while in the media player and navigate to "Options".

install this set and all channels should show up without renaming the files etc.  There is a chance that if you are not in one of the above areas that

the odd channel might be missing (local or specialty etc) and you will have to source the missing channel image.

The download is about 58MB in size.

Disclaimer - I have done my best to research (Google, Wikipedia, Lyngsat) and choose the correct logo for each channel but there is a chance that there

may be some logos that won't match so please let me know and I will correct.  International logos were a bit of a problem as most channels didn't have a

hi res image availible but I think they turned out ok most of the time.

Updates: 1.01 - Correct NBC and Comedy Central Logos and recompress as 800x400 32bit PNGs (Thanks TwistedMelon)

  <Description>MyMovies is a Movie Collection manager original designed for Windows Media Center. It has an extensive database of user contributed content encompassing metadata and fanart for movies. How this differs from IMDB.com and the like is that contribution to the database earns you points that can be used to unlock additional features and functionality in MyMovies.
MYMovies also supports a Server/Client architecture. Your collection can reside on a headless server and be managed by any other machine on your network running the client software. For more information on MyMovies please check out their website.
I started this project as a way to bring my favorite collection management tool from WMC, MyMovies into SageTV for myself. The project has become much larger than I ever expected.
Please note that this project was developed in my spare time. I have developed most of this by myself and I am only one person. I do not make any money from this project nor from My Movies. While I will try to fix issues in a timely manner, please try not to expect immediate responses as It can take some time to fix an issue. .

       <Description>

Native SageTV plugin for accessing EPG data via Schedules Direct.



Please read the user guide for this plugin CAREFULLY prior to installation!

There are special, additional steps required to install and uninstall this

plugin.



If you are upgrading from version 0.0.5.x or older then you MUST follow

the additional upgrade instructions outlined at http://bit.ly/1k5G6f9 otherwise

your EPG data will slowly disappear.



If you are upgrading from 0.0.6.x to anything newer then you do not need

to do anything special.  Just apply the updated plugin from the plugin manager

and restart SageTV.

       <Name>SageAlert</Name>
       <Identifier>sagealert</Identifier>
       <Description><![CDATA[
SageAlert listens for important/interesting SageTV events and will send notifications of those events to various notification platforms.
 
Currently, SageAlert supports sending notifications to the following server types:
 
* Email
* Twitter
* Growl
* CSV file
* Process executor
 
Simply load the web GUI for SageAlert and configure the various events by telling SageAlert which notifications to send for each supported event type.  Then when those events are received by SageAlert, you will receive the notification(s) as configured.
 
Typical uses of SageAlert include:
 
* Post tweets of interesting events to a Twitter account for your HTPC.  Your SageTV server can tweet what it's recording, when clients connect/disconnect, when users are watching tv (and what they're watching, etc.).
 
* Receive an email any time someone connects to the SageTV server.
 
* Receive an email any time a system message is posted by SageTV.  This is an excellent way to receive instant alerts of possible problems with your SageTV server.
 
* If your cell phone provider has an email to SMS gateway (most do these days) then you can receive text messages about system messages, connected users, etc.
 
* Start up a process in response to an alert; the contents of the alert (subject, message, source event) are provided as environment variables in the process' execution environment.
 
At this time, all configuration of SageAlert is done via the web GUI, which is installed at the /sagealert/ context in your Jetty plugin.  A future version of SageAlert may introduce some configuration options into the STV.
 
Other plugins can also register and fire events to SageAlert, which can then be configured for notification.
